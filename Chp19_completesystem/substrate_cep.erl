%The substrate_cep process gathers the control signals from the neurons, appending them to the accumulator. The order in which the signals are accumulated into a vector is in the same order that the neuron ids are stored within NIds. Once all the signals have been gathered, the substrate_cep executes its function, forwards the processed signal to the substrate, and then again begins to wait for the neural signals from the output layer by reseting the Fanin_PIds from the second copy of the list.
